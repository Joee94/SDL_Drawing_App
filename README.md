SDL_Drawing_App
===============
My SDL Drawing App, made for an Assignment in which we had the choice between a game and a Vector Drawing Application, I went for the latter because it just sounded interesting.

Todo:
<ul>
  <li>Colour the background and shapes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Find a way for user to input a Hex or RGB value</li>
    <li>Simply add a new parameter to the draw function for the colour</li>
  </ul>
<li>Load and Save files when they want</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Drag a file in to load it??? SDL_DropEvent possibly</li>
    <li>Save a file by somehow getting them to input a name</li>
    <li>If they don't save or load it's saved in temp then overwritten next time it's opened</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
